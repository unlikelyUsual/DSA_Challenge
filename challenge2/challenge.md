## **ðŸ§  What's the Mission?**

**Design a serverless architecture for a notification service that efficiently sends personalized notifications to users, ensuring exactly-once delivery and scalability to handle high traffic.**

## âŒ› Max time: 30 mins

## ðŸ“œÂ **Requirements:**

1. **Notification Processing:**
   - Design a serverless architecture to process notification requests, including message transformation, filtering, and delivery.
2. **Idempotence:**
   - Ensure exactly-once delivery of notifications using idempotent design patterns to prevent duplicate notifications.
3. **Decoupling:**
   - Utilize design patterns to decouple notification processing from notification delivery, promoting modularity and flexibility.
4. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - Ensure the architecture can handle a throughput of 500 requests per second and provide a responsive user experience.
5. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Implement fault-tolerant mechanisms to handle failures gracefully.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Design Patterns:**
   - Effective application of Event-Driven Architecture, Publish-Subscribe, and Idempotent Design to ensure robustness and reliability and circuit breaker for fault tolerance.
2. **Serverless Framework Skills:**
   - Demonstrated proficiency in AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Amazon SQS to build a scalable and cost-efficient solution.
3. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - Ability to design an architecture that dynamically scales to meet demand while maintaining performance.
4. **Decoupling and Abstraction:**
   - Effective use of design patterns to decouple and abstract components, promoting maintainability and extensibility.
5. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Implementation of fault-tolerant mechanisms.
